# E-learning
This repository consists of tools for use with KTH's LMS and other systems to facilitate e-learning activities of faculty, students, and staff.

These tools are intended to be examples of how one can use the Canvas Restful API and to
provide some useful functionality (mainly for teachers).

Programs can be called with the option "-v" or "--verbose" you get lots of output - showing in detail the operations of the program.

Additionally, programs can be called with an alternative configuration file using the syntax: --config FILE

for example:  --config config-test.json

See the default-config.json file for an example of the structure of this file. Replace the string xxx by your access token and replace the string yyy.instructure.com with the name of the server where your Canvas LMS is running.
